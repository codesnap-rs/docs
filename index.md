```

Build snapshots programmatically using:

```rust
let code_content = Content::Code(
  CodeBuilder::from_t
  .content(r#"print "Hello, World!""#)
  .language("python")
  .build()?,
);

let snapshot = CodeSnap::from_default_theme()
  .content(code_content)
  .build()?
  .create_snapshot()?;

// Copy the snapshot data to the clipboard
snapshot.raw_data()?.copy()
```
